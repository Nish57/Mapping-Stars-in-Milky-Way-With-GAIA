Welcome to the "Map the Local Milky Way With GAIA" repository! This project involves visualizing the "Map the Local Milky Way With GAIA" dataset to gain insights into our local Milky Way galaxy using data from the GAIA satellite.
## Overview

In this project, we explore and visualize data related to our local Milky Way galaxy. The dataset is derived from the GAIA satellite and provides information about stars, their positions, distances, and properties within our galaxy. The goal of this visualization is to map and understand the distribution of stars in our neighborhood of the Milky Way.

## Contents

- `mapping-milky-way-stars.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data visualization process, including data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `gaiaDataNearSun.csv`: The dataset used for the visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/pranjalprateek6/Mapping-Stars-in-Milky-Way-With-GAIA
   ```
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebook milky-way-visualization.ipynb to view the data visualizations and insights into our local Milky Way galaxy.

## Dependencies
This project is based on Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
## Data Source
The dataset used in this visualization was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinhinkel/galacticcoordswithgaia], and it provides valuable information about stars in our local Milky Way galaxy as observed by the GAIA satellite.
